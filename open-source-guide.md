# Open Source Policies

## Why are we making our projects open source?


## What other open source projects do we use?

We rely on a variety of open source tools and projects to support our work. An incomplete list includes:

- Omeka and Curatescape
- Zotero
- CiviCRM
- Atom.io

# GitHub Project Style Guide

## Naming new projects

* Is the name clear and descriptive?

## Making repo descriptions short and clear

If your project is active, does your description:

* Let someone know exactly what’s in the repo?
* Describe the code and the project in a sentence or two?

If your project is no longer active, does your description:

* Note it’s no longer active by placing the word DEPRECATED in front of the description?
* Indicate where people can find the active version of the project, if one exists?

[Use the Emoji searcher](http://emoji.muan.co) to find an approriate emoji to insert at the beginning of your repo description. Emojis can help repos stand out and help people to understand what the repo is for.

## Making READMEs readable

Does your README answer the following questions:

* What is the project?
* How does someone develop, use, and test the code?
* How can people become more involved?
* What is the licensing for this project?
* How do people contact the developers or ask a question?

## Writing clear issues

Are your issues:

* Written clearly and in the style of a user story?
* Labeled clearly with the type of help you need?
* Detailed with additional documentation as needed?

# Contributor Guidelines

We are in the process of developing contributor guidelines for each of our open source Baltimore Heritage projects. This document will provide more general guidance to getting stated with GitHub and how you can get involved.
