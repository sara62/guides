# How to plan a Baltimore by Bike heritage tour

# General recommendations

- Continue to offer a range of rides with a variety of lengths and difficulty levels.
- Use registration caps (or multiple dates for popular tours) to ensure a manageable size for the group - not too small and not too big.
- No unicycles!
- Strongly encourage participants to review a pre-ride maintenance checklist.
- Consider adding a waiver as part of the registration process.
- Keep the rides running on schedule.
- Keep the process simple for volunteer tour guides.
- Attach flags to the tour leader and any volunteer support riders to clearly mark the group within traffic.
- Consider partnerships with bike shops for bike rental to local visitors.
- Distribute a Google Maps version of the final route to all volunteers and participants with a confirmation email.

# Planning the ride

## Plan the route
- Heritage bike tours are usually organized a few key themes or related landmarks located within close enough proximity to make a 8-10 mile route a feasible option.
- Consider using Google Maps to plan the route and share it with other volunteers and organizers during the planning process.
- Riding the route before the tour can help identify any issues related to road conditions, traffic, confusing directions or other common concerns.
- Create a cue sheet and route map. Flag the locations of any bike shops along the route to direct any participants who have mechanical problems or other issues that force them to stop mid-ride.
- If possible, plan to route to include an optional stop at a restroom facility at the beginning, middle or end of the ride.
	
## Pick a date
- Saturday or Sunday morning are typically our prefered dates/times for the reduced automotive traffic.
- If possible, avoid conflicts with related programs or events, e.g. Tour du Port, Charm City Cross, etc.

## Set a time
- Usually 9:30am unless there is a pretty good reason to set another time. Early afternoon is difficult for parents with small children (naptime) but our morning rides are difficult for families with sports and other kids activities on the weekends.

## Set a starting location
- Good starting locations should be easy to find, have some parking available for anyone who drives to the start of the ride, and have a large enough flat/paved area for the group to gather before the ride begins.
- If planning a ride that starts at a larger or busier park, like Druid Hill Park or Patterson Park, check with the park "friends" group to confirm that there are no conflicting events.

## Write an announcement
- Sell it! Share details about the starting location, any activities available after the ride or landmarks along the way.
- Be clear about the anticipated level of difficulty, anticipated mileage
