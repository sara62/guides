The purpose of this advocacy guide is to document our the approaches that we use at Baltimore Heritage in our advocacy for historic preservation broadly and around specific preservation issues.

# What is advocacy?
 
 According a helpful [overview by Independent Sector](https://www.independentsector.org/advocacy) nonprofit advocacy is a broad term covering a range of activities that seek to bring about systemic social change. These activities include

- Lobbying: attempts to influence specific legislation through direct or grassroots communications with legislators or their staf
- Issue organizing
- Nonpartisan voter engagement
- Executive branch activities

# What is the role of advoacy in historic preservation?

There are a variety of preservation issues that require advocacy:

- Issues related to private property owners with regard to a specific property/group of properties
- Issues related to a type of property and a related issue experienced by multiple private property owners
- Issues related to instutional property owners (hospitals, universities, etc.) and properties they hold
- Public policy issues related to development, design and planning
- Public policy issues related to funding and incentives

# How does Baltimore Heritage approach advocacy?

Our approach to advoacy involves coordination and communications between a variety of individuals and organizations including:

- Staff
- Preservation avocacy committee
- Board
- Partners
- Residents

Our advocacy often includes significant components of education, technical assistance and capacity building but those are not the focus of this guide. We are developing a separate guide on education and technical assistance.

Our approach to advocacy includes:

- Attending community meetings to discuss preservation issues
- Testifying at public hearings to voice our position on preservation issues
- Sharing information on preservation issues through our website and social media

# How do we identify advocacy issues?

There are several common ways that Baltimore Heritage identifies advocacy issues:

- A resident contacts us with concerns about a specific property or development project
- A community organization contacts us with a request for information or support related to a specific property or development project
- A historic property owner contacts us with an inquiry about resources or funding for their property
- An elected official contacts us in response to a constituent inquiry about a historic preservation issue

Sometimes these contacts are made directly to Baltimore Heritage staff. In other cases, a concerned resident or community organization might contact a Baltimore Heritage board member or volunteer who then refers the question to our staff for us to investigate.

# How do we research advocacy issues?

The first step in any advocacy issue is getting a clear understanding of what the issue may be.

If an issue involves a specific property, we seek answers to these questions: 

- Who owns the property at present?
- What is the ownership history of the property?
- How large is the site (acreage) and the property (interior square footage)?
- How is the property zoned?

# How do we keep track of advocacy issues?

- Trello board
- Website
- Map

# How do we plan advocacy campaigns?

- What are our goals?
- Who is our audience?

Preparing Successful Lobbying Materials
Making your Case with Handouts

Handouts, leave-behinds, and one-pagers help you paint a picture of the impact federal policy makes at the local level, an impact that is critical to illustrate during advocacy at the state and federal level. When you meet with a representative you will relatively little time to make your case and need to focus on specific points and asks during that time, so consider assembling a briefing book as a critical complement to your visit that your representative and their staff can reference when needed.
