# Overview

**Please note:** This document is a very rough working draft! If you have questions or suggestions, please [get in touch with Baltimore Heritage](http://baltimoreheritage.org/contact).

The purpose of this guide is to facilitate the process of getting new partners, volunteers, board members or contract workers set up with the accounts and services they need to contribute to Baltimore Heritage projects or partnerships. We are sharing this document with the idea that it may serve as a useful model for other small nonprofits. We also welcome feedback from anyone on how we can improve our process for collaboration with volunteers and contractors. As this document is developed further, it may be appropriate to separate the content into separate documents.

This document is currently organized into two large sections on **Communications and Scheduling** and **Sharing & Project Management**. The sub-sections are organized around the specific tools or services that we frequently use and train volunteers on using. The management of our main website should be addressed in a separate guide. Tools and services for managing our social media communications are also in a separate guide.

# Prerequisites

Note: This section on prerequisites may be unecessary but it would be nice to link to some basic web literacy resources for anyone who might need them.

- A computer
- An internet connection
- A web browser

# Communications and Scheduling

## Google Accounts and Gmail

### What do we use Google Accounts for?

### Using a baltimoreheritage.org email address

With Google Apps for Education account, we have a limited number of free email accounts (_note_: find out how many we still have available?) that we can provide to people who may need them. These accounts use the baltimoreheritage.org and should only be provided to individuals who we expect can use them responsibly. If an individual no longer requires the email account, the contents of the Inbox can be archived and the account deactivated or deleted. (_note_: look up information on archiving from Google Apps and best practices for archiving emails in general)

###  Using a gmail.com email address

Given our extensive use of Google services (and the use of Google Accounts) to manage the login for our website, Trello, etc., we encourage people to set up a gmail.com account to work with us. If they prefer not to check the gmail.com inbox, we can guide them through the process of setting up forwarding from the gmail.com inbox to another email.

>With contact groups you can easily organize your contacts, making it easier to email a specific set of people. For example, if you created a contact group called "Soccer club", you could just send a message to that group, rather than sending out an email to 50 different people. Never leave somebody off an email again!

_How to create a new Google Drive folder for a project or partnership_

1. Create a Google Drive folder in Projects or Partnerships (depending on the nature of the collaboration)
2. Create an overview document within the folder with the same name as the folder (with the addition of the suffix “– Overview”).
3. If a large number of files will be located in this folder, create sub-folders for Related Resources, Images, Data, Source Documents, and Research/Writing. Common files include an image log, a chronology, etc.
