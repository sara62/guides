# Baltimore Heritage Guides

## What is this?

This repository is a collection of documentation materials and tutorials created for use by Baltimore Heritage staff and volunteers. We have made these resources open source as part of our ongoing Local Preservation School project and we plan to continue developing these materials as a shared resource for anyone interested in learning more about how our organization approaches advocacy, communications, outreach, education and public programs.

## Who is Baltimore Heritage?

Founded in 1960, Baltimore Heritage, Inc. is Baltimore’s nonprofit historic and architectural preservation organization. With two staff members, 33 volunteer board members, and a host of volunteers, we work to preserve and promote Baltimore’s historic buildings and neighborhoods. Find us [on GitHub](https://github.com/baltimoreheritage) or [visit our website](http://baltimoreheritage.org/) to learn more about our work.

## How can you contribute to these guides?

We welcome comments, corrections and additions from anyone with an interest in helping us to improve our documentation or the approach that we take to our work. Please feel free to submit an issue or fork this respository then make a pull request. We are working on developing an open source style guide and contributor guidelines for this and other projects.
