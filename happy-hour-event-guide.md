# Planning a happy hour

- Recruit a group of 2-3 volunteers to help plan and promote the event	
- Select a venue (e.g. bar or historic site)
	- _If a bar_, call the venue to check on the date/time, ask about drink or food specials.
	- _If a historic site_, make sure to clarify where the group is allowed to drink and eat. Don’t forget to make arrangements for purchasing alcohol.
- Select a date and time
	- Check dates with the Baltimore Heritage program calendar or other partner calendars to avoid direct conflicts with existing scheduled programs.
- Write a short description of the happy hour
	- Include parking, transit, drink specials and a bit of history. The description should be 3-6 sentences and use a friendly, informal voice.
- Plan any additional programs for the happy hour
	- Past programs have included short walking tours, short presentations, or an opportunity to talk with a special group of visitors
	- Programs are a good opportunity for partnership, e.g. the happy hour could precede or follow some other event or highlight a project/exhibit/campaign by a partner group
- Set up form for RSVPs or ticket sales
- Print registration sheet shortly before the event

## Selecting a dates and time

Many professional happy hour programs avoid Friday evening or weekend evenings since many people make personal social plans on those days. In the happy hour programs we’ve done so far, we held events on Friday and Thursday and did not notice a strong connection between the day of the week and turnout. We also varied the start time between 5:00pm and 6:30pm and again did not get a clear sense that one time worked better than any other. When meeting at a bar, earlier times make it easier to take advantage of existing happy hour specials!

## Selecting a venue

The happy hours are most successful when the space feels full but not crowded and the noise level is low enough to allow for conversation. Some venues - e.g. Brewer’s Art, Joe Squared - were too loud for a successful happy hour! Others - e.g. J. Patrick’s - had few patrons other than our group making the event feel less full or active than it otherwise might. If a bar is willing to provide a separate space for our group - e.g. second floor or back room - make sure to have a clear understanding of how many people they expect to attend if they are providing service staff.

# Promoting the happy hour

Happy hours are a great way to make new friends but the best way to get someone to join the event is if one of their current friends sends them a personal invitation. Facebook alone is a _terrible_ way to get people engaged and excited to come out to a program. Calendars and social media should be seen as supplementing the core audience of email list subscribers and friends/colleagues of organizers and volunteers.

- Set-up a Facebook event for the happy hour
- Email the announcement to the Baltimore Heritage Happy Hour list
- Promote the happy hour through social media and emails to friends/colleagues
- Request any partners include information on the happy hour in regular email newsletter
- Submit the announcement to online/print event calendars (e.g. City Paper)
- Don’t forget to check in with venue by phone or in person in the afternoon	

# During the happy hour

## Bring supplies
	- name tags and sharpies	
	- registration sheet
	- change envelope with cash - if attendee payment is required
	- sign-up sheet for email list
	- any additional flyers or hand-outs
	- any supplies needed for programs - e.g. projector, loudspeaker

## General recommendations
- Welcome people as they arrive and introduce volunteers and organizers
- Sign people in and collect payment as needed
- Try to introduce people to others to promote a friendly conversation
- Thank people as they leave

## If you are organizing a program...
	- ...before the happy hour, make sure a volunteer goes to the venue early to greet anyone who is not attending the program
	- ...during the happy hour, try to start the program early enough in the evening that people are still arriving, not leaving

## At the end of the evening
	- If it is a bar, let any remaining attendees know that you are leaving but they are welcome to stay. Thank the bartender or owner.
	- If it is a historic site, let any remaining attendees know they need to leave. Help clean-up. Thank the owner or host.
		
# After the happy hour!
- Send thank you email to venue
- Send thank you email to any partners or volunteers
- Upload photos of the event to Baltimore Heritage Facebook or Flickr accounts
- Get started on planning the next one!
